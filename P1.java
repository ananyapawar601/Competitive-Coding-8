/*
Time Complexity (TC)
O(N + M), where
N is the length of s
M is the length of t
We traverse s at most twice: once expanding (r pointer) and once contracting (l pointer), making it O(N).
Constructing the frequency array for t takes O(M).
Overall, O(N + M) â‰ˆ O(N).

Space Complexity (SC)
O(1) because the frequency array (hash) has a fixed size of 256, which is constant.

We first build a frequency array hash for characters in t, then use two pointers (l and r) to expand and contract the window dynamically.
As we expand (r), we decrement hash[s.charAt(r)] and increase count when a needed character is found.
Once all characters are matched (count == t.length()), we attempt to shrink the window (l++) while updating the minimum window length, finally returning the smallest valid substring.
